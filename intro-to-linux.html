<p>Here is a brief description of this course:</p>

<br>


<p class="color">

Develop a good working knowledge of Linux using both the graphical interface and command line, covering the major Linux distribution families.</p>



<p class="color">Linux powers 94% of the world’s supercomputers, most of the servers powering the Internet, the majority of financial trades worldwide and a billion Android devices. In short, Linux is everywhere. It appears in many different architectures, from mainframes to server to desktop to mobile and on a staggeringly wide variety of hardware.</p>



<p class="color">Moreover, 97 percent of hiring managers reported that they will prioritize hiring Linux talent relative to other skills areas in the next six months, and 44 percent of hiring managers saying they’re more likely to hire a candidate with Linux certification.</p>



<p class="color">This course explores the various tools and techniques commonly used by Linux system administrators and end users to achieve their day-to-day work in a Linux environment. It is designed for experienced computer users who have limited or no previous exposure to Linux, whether they are working in an individual or Enterprise environment.</p>



<p class="color">Upon completion of this training you should have a good working knowledge of Linux, from both a graphical and command line perspective, allowing you to easily navigate through any of the major Linux distributions. You will be able to continue your progress as either a user, system administrator or developer using the acquired skill set.</p>



<p class="color">Join the 250,000+ students who are already enrolled in this course and start your Linux journey.</p>

<p>There are a total of 18 Chapters/Lessons in this course.</p>

<p>For example, Chapter 01 is called, "The Linux Foundation." In this course I learned a lot about the Linux Foundation and the course software requirements.</p>



<p>In Chapter 02 called, "Linux Philosophy and Concepts" I learned a lot about Linux philosophy, how Linux started, Linux terminology and Linux distributions.</p>



<div id="penguindistros">

<p><img src="images/penguindistros.jpg" alt="Linux Distros" width="720" height="475" /></p>

</div><!--penguindistros-->





<p>In Chapter 03 called, "Linux Structure and Installation" I learned about the Linux filesystem and how they are organized. I also learned about the Boot Process and also how to install Linux. I had already learned how to install Linux before like I mentioned in my previous posts <a href="../dream-or-nightmare.html" target="_blank">Dream or Nightmare (Part 1)</a> and <a href="../virtualbox.html" target="_blank">The Joys of VirtualBox</a>. But it was still a good thing to go over.</p>



<p>Chapter 04 and Chapter 05 had to do with learning and using the Linux Graphical Interface and how to configure some of your system settings (like network, display screen, date and time settings etc.) and installing and updating software.</p>


<p>Chapter 06 was all about how to find Linux Documentation in case you get stuck and need help or need more information or clarification about a particular thing.</p>


<p>Chapter 07 was all about the command line and how to use commands to perform operations within Linux. Commands such as searching for files, creating and managing files, installing and updating software, etc. I particulary LOVE shutting down my computer using the command line. It feels so bad ass when you do. Hahahaha. Okay...moving on!</p>




<div id="vadercommandline">

<p><img src="images/vadercommandline.png" alt="Darth Vader Command Linux Command Line" width="720" height="475" /></p>

</div><!--vadercommandline-->




<p>Chapter 08 was about File Operations. Chapter 09 was about User Environments. Chapter 10 was about the different kinds of text editors that you can use, some of them even terminal based like the Nano text editor which I had spoken about in my post, "<a href="../proxychains.html" target="_blank">The World Of Proxy</a>."</p>


<p>Chapter 11 was one of my favorites because it dealt with Local Security Principles. It showed you a few ways to help make your Linux system as secure as possible by setting strong passwords and using certain tools to check their strength. It also went into detail about the powers (and dangers) of being a root user and the differences between "su" and "sudo."</p>


<p>Chapters 12 to 18 dealt with Network Operations, Manipulating Text, How to use and configure your local printer, some Bash Shell Scripting, and common Linux applications.</p>

<p>The chapter on the Bash Shell made me realize that many of those command lines are extremely similar to the commands in Python. So since I'm learning Python I wonder if instead of doing Bash commands to carry out certain tasks I can instead carry out those commands in Python. I must experiment with this for sure.</p>

<p>And then after you complete all 18 Chapters/Lessons you take a final exam. Yup...you get tested on how well you understood the subject matter. You need at least a 70% or higher to pass the exam.</p>


<p>My goal was to get at least a 90% on it. And I was pleasantly surprised when I over exceeded my goal score!  Want to see what I got? Check it:</p>

</div><!--audit2-->



 
 <p>I was really REALLY proud of my score! Yay! Now I'm just waiting to see if I got accepted for the <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/free-linux-training/linux-training-scholarship-program" target="_blank">2016 Linux Foundation Training Scholarship Program</a>. I applied under the following category:</p> 


 <p class="color">Women in Open Source:</p>

<p class="color">We invite women who have demonstrated leadership or want to take initiative in creating opportunity for themselves or other women in the Linux and open source community to submit applications in this category.</p>


<p>Well I'm definitely a woman and I'm taking the initiave in creating an opportunity for myself in learning about Linux. So I figure why the heck not? I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>


<p>Since I completed the Intro to Linux course with flying colors AND learned a lot through the whole process AND applied for the 2016 Linux Foundation Training Scholarship Program...you know what that means right? It's time to celebrate with the Woohoo Dance!</p>
