<p>I knew it was coming. The Google crackdown on every site that didn't contain the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure prefix (HTTPS) which is the secure version of HTTP. If you do not have the right url prefix on your site (HTTPS) and an SSL certificate then Google is going to punish you. How? They will make sure that when anyone searches and finds you on the web you will be red flagged as "Not Secure" for everyone to see.</p>

<p>This is NOT good because what if you made money through your site or you depend on your site to bring in a lot of people every day? As soon as someone finds your site and they see the "Not Secure" sign attached to your site they're going to be like "Oh oh...this must not be a legit site" or "Oh man...I better not check out this site cause it could give me a virus and I just got over the flu two days ago. I really don't need another virus right now" or "It looks like this site has been hacked. I'm out of here" or "This site is definitely not safe. Forget this. I'm going to buy what I came here to buy from somewhere else."</p>

<p>And then what happens? You lose business and customers and devoted peole who love to go to your site. All because you do not have the HTTPS and SSL certificate on your site. So you get punished. And Google will make sure of that.</p>

<p>I'm sure you have noticed that some URLs start with "http://" while others start with "https://". Do you see that extra "s"? That extra "s" in "https://" means that when you connect to that site with the extra "s" your connection to that site is secure and encrypted. Any data you enter is safely shared with only that website and nobody else. Just you and that site. That's it. That is what SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is all about.</p>

<p>So what is SSL? SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It's basically a way to ensure that all data trasmitted between the web server and browser is encrypted and remains encrypted between you and the site.</p>

<p>So how does this work? Very easily! Let's say you were browsing the web one day. And OMG you just saw the the cutest pair of shoes or outfit or a must have book! What do you decide to do, especially after seeing there's only one shoe/outift/book left? You click the button that says "Buy Me", go to your "CART" and click on "Check Out". You then proceed to enter your credit card information and everything you need to get these adorable cute shoes/outfit/book.</p>

<p>What is wrong with this picture? What are some important things you can do to make sure that the site you're giving your credit card info is secured? Here's just a tiny quick thing you can do to protect yourself and your wallet. There are other steps as well but for the sake of this article I'm just mentioning these two.</p>


<br>


<ol>
	<li>Look at the URL of the site that you're on. Does it have the prefix "http" or "https"? If it's "http" that means that you're visiting a site that is not secure and you'd better double check the site's safety and see if you're absolutely 100 percent sure you want to enter your credentials and credit card information there. If the site begins with "https" instead of "http" then this site you're on is secured using an SSL certificate. The "s" in "https" stands for "secure." There are different levels of SSL validation and some are difficult to get (and expensive) while others are easier to get (and even free). But for now just remember to look out for that "s" in "http". </li>


	<br>

	<li>Look at the URL of the site that you're on. Do you see a closed padlock icon? If you see one go ahead and click on the locked padlock icon. It should say something like "Secure Connection" on it. And if you click on it one more time you will even get to see who the site was verified by. And if you click on it a third time you can see the SSL certificate of the site and a little more info on who verified it etc. Seeing this locked padlock means that you're on an encrypted and or verified site. It means that your information will be encrypted when it's sent so that hackers can't see it.</li>

</ol>

<br>

<p>Moral of the story here is...if you do not see any of those two things mentioned above (there is more to this topic but this is just touching it lightly) then run away from the site and do NOT give out your credentials. I repeat do NOT give out your credentials.</p>


<p>Let's go back to you buying those cute shoes/outfit/book on that site. If that site you're buying those items from does not have those two things mentioned above it basically means that the credit card information and credentials you have just put in are not encrypted. This means your personal information can be intercepted by a hacker or other kind of criminal to use for their nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>Now let's say the site you're on is encrypted with SSL. What happens is when the browser you're using starts to make a connection with the webserver it will look at the SSL certificate and then combine your browser and server in a way that I will not be explaining here in this article (but perhaps in a future one). When this binding connection happens it becomes secure so that only you and the website you're submitting your personal information can see it and have access to it. And this is what you want. A secure encrypted connection!</p>

<p>I will show you in a future article how I made Hacktra.com secure by installing an SSL certificate. I was very surprised how easy it was to do. I thought it was going to be very involved and complicated but it sure was not the case! Since I learned how to make my site more secure and learned a lot about SSL in the process you know what that means right? It's time for the Woohoo Dance!</p>
